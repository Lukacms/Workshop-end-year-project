# How to create a Github Project ?
Assuming it's a personnal repository on which you have all the rights.

* click on the `Projects` tab
* `New project` button

## Views
You can have multiple views, rename them...
* Table view: default view; you'll be able to see all the issue's informations, status, assignees, ...

## Issues
The issues in themselves are not too complicated:
* create one and link it to the project
* add necessary configurations / enhancements (status (automatically to ToDo), labels, assignees, ...)
When created, it's gonna have an id (eg: #6).
